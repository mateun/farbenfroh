# farbenfroh engine

This is an opensource game engine, based mainly on c++, and with lua for configuration files and scripting. 
Its main features are: 

* provides a nice abstraction layer around numerous established libraries (e.g. OZZ, DETOUR, RECAST, GLM, LUA etc) to provide many useful features for
game development. 
* full power and control with the actual c/c++ engine code, but easy useage for actual game
game development with lua configuration- and script files. 

## Building - TODO

## Example configuration
