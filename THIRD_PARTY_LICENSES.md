## Notes

If you modify any of these libraries, it is good practice (and often required) to note that changes were made in either:
- A `MODIFICATIONS.md` file per library
- Comments in the license section of this file

Please consult each library's full license text in the `extlibs/` folder or from their official repositories for exact terms and obligations.
