# ServerViz

In fact a game which simulates an arcade machine. 
The player must enter coins to play. 
We store the total amount of coins in steam and/or in a global list on the server. 
So we know, who has spent most coins. 

In addition we have a global highscore list. 

Bonus: Can the player enter the game in first person? as a dlc? like in tron?!

Then maybe, in the game, there is another arcade with a machine :) 
fractal... recursive... getting harder every time. 
In the end you don't know if you every started outside of the game or not?!

So every run consists of the arcade game, then you go inside (FPS), find the arcade, play it, go inside ... and so on

When you start the game, you have some coins. What happens, if you run out of coins? 
Then you can actually leave the arcade. In fact, you can do this anytime, but you may have no clue
that you can. 
Latest when running out of coins, you are told, maybe earn some?!

So, the arcade serves as a kind of end goal and beginning. Philosophical a bit?!

And I can make a top down and FPS in one!! Hybrid, no one likes! :)
